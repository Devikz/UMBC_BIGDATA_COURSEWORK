# Project Description
This project involves real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS) using live data streamed from an open API. The goal is to fetch the current coordinates of the ISS every 5 seconds and plot its movement on a world map over the course of an hour. This assignment demonstrates the use of Python for streaming data, handling APIs, and visualizing geospatial information.

# Objectives
1. Fetch real-time ISS location data from http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json.

2. Collect and store data points every 5 seconds for one hour.

3. Visualize the path of the ISS on a world map using the collected coordinates.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.

Requests: For making API calls.

Time: To handle regular intervals between API calls.

Matplotlib: For plotting ISS coordinates on a map.

Basemap/Cartopy: For enhanced geographic plotting.


# Output
1. Live collection of longitude and latitude points of the ISS.

2. A world map visual showing the travel path of the ISS in real-time.
