# YouTube Video Trend Analysis – Big Data 603 Project

This folder contains our final group project submission for the **DATA 603: Platforms for Big Data Processing** course at UMBC.

## Team Members
- Devika Rani Sanaboyina  
- Shobha Panthi  
- Dikshitha Tanneru

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze global YouTube video trends using Big Data technologies like **PySpark** and **Hadoop HDFS**. We aimed to understand what makes a video trend, focusing on factors such as video category, engagement metrics, post timing, and tags.

## Contents
- `603_Project_Final.ipynb`: Final Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, trend analysis, visualizations, and conclusions using PySpark and Matplotlib.
- `Project Presentation.pdf`: Slides summarizing the problem, methodology, key insights, and future scope.

## Key Insights
- Videos with more than 20 tags had lower engagement, suggesting over-tagging harms visibility.
- Evening and noon uploads underperformed across regions.
- Region-specific trends varied significantly: India and Pakistan showed concentrated interests; U.S. had diverse trending categories.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Hadoop HDFS
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: `pyspark.sql`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

## Potential Extensions
- NLP on comments/tags to gauge sentiment and intent.
- Cross-platform analysis with TikTok and Instagram data.
- AI-enhanced auto-tagging and edge-based trend detection.
